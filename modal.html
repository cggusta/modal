    George: Pity’s very underrated. I like it, its good. Kramer: [in the sauna]: It's like a sauna in here. George: It's not good to hold it in. I read that in a medical journal. Elaine: Snapple? Babu's Brother: No, too fruity. ; George: Who buys an umbrella anyway? You can get them for free at the coffee shop in those metal cans. George: A plane crash? A heart attack? Lupus? Is it lupus? Auctioneer: Ten thousand to the... shapely woman on the left? George: Alrighty. My last job was in publishing. I got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman. Kramer: She needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding. She needs a little Kramer. Jim Fowler [appearing on Kramer's set of The Merv Griffin Show]: Where are the cameras. Elaine: Is this going to hurt? Doctor: Yes, very much. Jerry: Nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes, you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort. Elaine: Snapple? Babu's Brother: No, too fruity. Kramer: Bookman. The library cop's name is Bookman. That's like an ice cream man being named cone. Jerry: Newman is my sworn enemy and he lives down the hall from my home. My home, Elaine! Where I sleep, where I come to play with my toys. Jerry: An audit. It's the financial equivalent of a complete rectal examination. Jerry: The New York Yankees? George: The New York Yankees! Jerry: Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle… Costanza. Jerry: Why do I get bananas? They're good for one day. Jerry: You want me to take an overview? I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.
    <br /><br />
    Elaine: Maybe the dingo ate your baby. George [trying to be cool]: I am down. I am totally down. Mark me down. Jerry: Sometimes the road less traveled is less traveled for a reason. Frank Costanza: You know what I like about Manhattan? No mosquitoes. Elaine: No, I don't have a square to spare. I can't spare a square! Telemarketer: Would you be interested in a subscription to the New York Times? Jerry: Yes. [hangs up. Jerry: Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun. You don't stare at it. You get a sense of it and you look away.

    Thanks! Jackie Chiles: Jackie's cashin' in on your wretched disfigurement. Timmy: Did you just double-dip that chip? Kramer: Yamahama, it's fright night! Newman: Hawaii... The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to lick the stamps? Elaine: The female body is a work of art. The male body is utilitarian. It's for gettin' around. It's like a Jeep? Kramer: Eight hours of jingle-belling and ho-ho-hoing. Boy, I am ho'd out! Elaine: You know, it's not fair people are seated first-come-first-served. It should be based on who's hungriest. Elaine: You know, just admitting that another man is attractive doesn't necessarily make you a homosexual. George: Doesn't help? Timmy: Did you just double-dip that chip. Jerry: You know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.
